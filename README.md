# Sem 2 - Data Structures using C

This branch contains C programs focused on data structures, written during my second semester.
It includes lab assignments, and common algorithm implementations to strengthen understanding of core data structure concepts.

### How To Build:
For instructions on how to compile and run the programs (using GCC), see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### Topics Include:
* Searching algorithms.
* Sorting algorithms.
* Stacks and queues.
* Linked list operations for stacks and queues.
* Tree operations.
* Dynamic arrays and basic use of pointers/memory.
