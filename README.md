# Sem 3 - Object Oriented Concepts using java

This branch contains Java programs written during my third semester, focusing on Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
Still early days â€” mostly foundational concepts and basic implementations using classes and objects.

### How To Build:
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for setup and usage instructions.

### Topics Include:
* Classes and objects.
* Constructors and method overloading.
* Inheritance and polymorphism.
* Encapsulation and abstraction.
