# Sem 1 - Basic Programming with C

This branch contains C programs from my first semester â€” mainly lab exercises, class tasks, and some extra practice.  
It's all basic-level stuff meant to get comfortable with core programming concepts using C.

### How To Build:
For instructions on how to compile and run the programs (using GCC), see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

### Topics Include:
* Input/output handling.
* Conditions, loops, and control flow.
* Math and logic-based problems.
* Arrays and strings.
* Simple pattern printing.
* Structures and basic data handling.
